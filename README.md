# SpeedLimitChecker
To operate this project, you have to get your csv file named data with the format of speed_limit,speed,licence_plate into \bin\Debug\net8.0 and there run the SpeedLimitChecker.exe. Then you need to enter the length of the data file in lines (e.g. 10000) and it will count all rule breakers and save their licence plate into the licence_plates.txt in this folder.
Note: There is already a testing data.csv file with 10000 lines so if you want to test it you dont have to have your own file just yet
